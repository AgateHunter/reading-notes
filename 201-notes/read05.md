# Lesson 05 - Images, Color Text, and More Work With Functions

## HTML Media

As has been discussed before, HTML is what gives a webpage its *structure*. Within HTML there is the ability to include images to make the webpage more interesting and visually appealing. The internet can be used by nearly everyone, including those who might not have full sight capabilitity. Creating acecssabile webesites is a vital part of being a knowledgable developer. The **alt** atribute stands for *alternative text*, which is a text description fo the image. Providing a descriptive *alt* will naturally create a more accessible HTML document. For example, a photo of Santa Clause could be described as "Man with clothes". A better alt tag would be "Tall, smiling older man with large white beard, red velvet coat and pants, black boots. A red velvet sack is on the ground next to him with toys inside."

Another way to identify an element within HTML is to use a **figure** element. Think of a < figure > like this. Imagine a textbook with a photo of a dinosaur. The photo is an < img > and there is a little bit of text that references with the image is < "Fig. 1.1: A T-Rex holding a microphone" >. Elsewhere in the webpage, I can allude to the image by saying See Figure 1.1. This is helpful in case someone doesn't know what a T-Rex looks like, or is relying on a screen reader.

SVG, or **Scalable Vector Graphics** is what is used to define graphics in XML. A better way to understand is to realized that SVG is the graphic equivalent of HTML to text. So if HTML is used to define the behaviors of text in a webpage, SVG defines the vector graphics in XML. XML stands for **eXtension Markup Lanaguage**. If I want to define how text will behave - headers, paragraphs, lists - I use HTML. If I want to define how graphics behave - width, height, style, fill - I will use SVG. 

A *gif* ( Graphics Interchange Format )is one of many types of image file types. You select a file type based on factors such as size, browsers, color mode, etc... Selecting a GIF means that you are wanting a compressed format that everyone would be able to use. It was created in 1987 and was one of the first formats supported by HTML. It is simple and compatible with bascially everything, and can be used when connections are slow.
