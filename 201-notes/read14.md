# Psychological Safety

Being able to express concerns, voice ideas, and ask questions is about more than just having the abilit to do so. Each of these things requires a level of vulnerability that puts the individual at risk of potential rejection, ridicule, or harm. It can also be a space of connection, collaboration, growth, and trust. What matters in these moments of vulenerability is psychological safety: *the shared belief within a group of people that it's okay to take risks.*

Three things that contribute to psychological safety are:
- Trust and mutual respect
- Supportive Leadership
- Effective Communication


From my own experience, I had a supervisor who worked tirelessly to demonstration in his actions that he was committed to creating psychologically safe enviornments. This meant that any meeting he attended, people became more at ease; they were able to ask questions with fear of judgement or looking "stupid". He was able to do this by being open, honest, professional yet kind, and never forgetting that we were real people with lives of our own. The first time he demonstrated compassion for what I was experiencing in my personal life made me want to be more present in my professional ife.


When a team is operating from a high level of psychological safety, there is greater productivity and creativity. Ideas are not held back, even if they're not "great". Others chime in and contribute perspectives that might not have otherwise been considered. Challenges and barriers are more easily addressed, because team members aren't afraid that speaking up about them will be correlated with perceived incompetence.

## CSS Transforms

CSS *transform* is a property that can be used in two different ways:
- 2D Transforms
- 3D Transforms

### 2D Transforms and 3D Transforms

Transforms elements on the x (horizontal) and y (vertical) axes. A ***3D transform*** does the same as 2D, except it adds the *z* axsis.
 + Rotate: Rotates any element up to 360 degrees
 + Scale: You can change the size within an element
 + Translate: The position of the element changes, but only on the axis that is identified. **TranslateX** for the position change of the horizontal axis, and **TranslateY** for the vertical axis
 + Skew: Distorts an element on its relative axis based on degrees
