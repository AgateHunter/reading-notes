## CSS Transforms

CSS *transform* is a property that can be used in two different ways:
- 2D Transforms
- 3D Transforms

### 2D Transforms and 3D Transforms

Transforms elements on the x (horizontal) and y (vertical) axes. A ***3D transform*** does the same as 2D, except it adds the *z* axsis.
 + Rotate: Rotates any element up to 360 degrees
 + Scale: You can change the size within an element
 + Translate: The position of the element changes, but only on the axis that is identified. **TranslateX** for the position change of the horizontal axis, and **TranslateY** for the vertical axis
 + Skew: Distorts an element on its relative axis based on degrees
