# Lesson 04 - Structured Web Pages with HTML



## Summary

#### What is HTML and why do we use it?

HTML stands for *Hyper Text Markup Language* and it is a language used to create Web pages. Within HTML are various *elements* that specifically tell the web browser
how the content should be displayed. Think of it as a director in a play; even without the costume or dialogue, the directors knows which each
character of a play is:

- You are a bunny rabbit
- You are a tree
- You are the main character

Similarly, HTML tells content how it should be displayed:

+ You are a heading size 3
+ You are BOLD!
+ You are subscript
 
#### What are the 3 main parts of an HTML element?

Any HTML element needs to have 3 main parts

1. The **start tag** - < starttag > This starts the element
2. The **content** - What goes next
3. The **end tage** - < endtag > This closes the element

##### EXAMPLE

**Start Tag** *< p >* **Content** *Hello World* **End Tag** *< /p >*

### EXTRA! EXTRA! Read all about it!

*Semantics* in HTML is all about what an element ***means***. It is one thing to assign an element to content, and it is the job of the semantics to ascribe its meaning. Using the example of **bold**, we
can know that the semantics "bold" in HTML means that the weight of the font will be heavier and darker. 

*Semantic elements* are tags that describe the meaning of what is contained within them. It gives greater structure to the HTML page and the other pieces of content within those tags.

Here is a good example, from the website Semrush:
