## So What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a programming language that gives a web page its *behaviors*. It a nutshell, JavaScript can tell a web page what it should **do**.

 ### Variables, Declarations, and Assignments, Oh My!

 Within JavaScript, you will have ***variables***. Variables are our various types of data. It could be *'x'* or *n*, or  *i*. These variables need to be defined, and have somewhere to live. **Declarations**
 ways to store data, after telling it what it is. Think of it like having a box, or a bucket. You might put anything inside of your container, but in order to hold anything, you must have a receptical.  
Once a variable has been declared, it needs to have an assignment. An ***assignment operator*** gives the *value* the the newly declared variable. Everything together may look like this:

 - **var**: var x = 3 ( variable )
 - **let**: let x = 24 ( similar to const )
 - **const**: const x = 'Happy Birthday' ( constant )
 - **Automatic**: x =3 ( declaring a variable )
