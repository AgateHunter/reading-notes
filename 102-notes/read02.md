## "I Don't Need Any GUI!"

Using a comuputer has been made more simple over the years due to a GUI, or Graphical User Interface. This allows the user to navigate the computer using icons and visual cues. 
Prior to the creation of GUI operating systems, computers used a text based interface to navigate the system.  *Terminal* and *Command Line* are needed to input commands into a computer.
The terminal is the environment for text input and output, while the command line is the space where you type the command. These terms are often used interchangeably. 

### Things to Look For in a **GOOD** Text Editor

Simply put, a text editor is software that allows you to enter and manipulate text. Common text editors are **Microsoft Word**, **Google Docs**, and **Word Perfect**.
When looking for a text editor, you should consider the following:

1. **Code Completion**
2. **Ability to highlight syntax**
3. **Many different themes**
4. **A wide selection of extensions**

## Practical Example

When using the Terminal, consider that you need to enter the following commands. What do they do?

- cd projects: **C**hange **D**irectories to *projects*
- mkdir new-project: **m**a**k**e a **dir**ectory called *new-project* in ***projects***
- touch new-project/newfile.md: create ***touch*** a new page *inside* new-project called ***newfile.md***
- cd .. : go back 1 ( .. ) level
- ls projects/new-project: **l**i**s**t the contents of the folder *new/project*
