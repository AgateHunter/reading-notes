Growth Mindset##

Growth Mindset is the framework that a person's ability to grow and develop is *dynamic*, and the believe in one's ability to learn allows for this growth.
In contrast, those who believe that challenges, obstacles, setbacks, and frustration are all symptoms of their lack of ability or intellegence view life through a fixed mindset. This is a belief that our "intellegence" and ability are *static*. 

**Stay Growing**

1. I will approach all challenges with curiosity
> ~~I tried to write this with markup, and it didn't work. I can't code.~~
>
> *VS*
> 
> I tried to write this with markup, and it didn't work. **Hmm, I wonder why. Let me ask my classmate**


2. I will be open to accepting criticisim as a way to learn from others
  
   "Natalie, your code looks like garbage!" I should ask him what he means by that, and what area could be improved.


3. This is my journey to run at my own speed.
