##Growth Mindset

Growth Mindset is the framework that a person's ability to grow and develop is dynamic, and the believe in one's ability to learn allows for this growth.
In contrast, those who believe that challenges, obstacles, setbacks, and frustration are all symptoms of their lack of ability or intellegence view life through a fixed mindset. This is a belief that our "intellegence" and ability are static.
