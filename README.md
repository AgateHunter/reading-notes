# Code Fellows Reading Notes


## Introduction
My name is Natalie Stone, and I am a Software Developer with Code Fellows. After an expansive career as a military musician, I decided to change course and explore the ways that I can positively impact the world around me through technology. ![GithHub Profile](https://github.com/AgateHunter)

## About This Page
Join me on my learning journey, as I exercise my mind's capacity to learn new things, and practices the many ways of having a growth mindset. On this page, I will be documenting key concepts necessary for strong software developers, and sharing them in a way that is easily accessible, even to those with no technical background!
