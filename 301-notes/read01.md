# Lesson 01 - Introduction to React and Components

In order to use React, it is first necessary to understand the foundation of Component-Based Architecture. This module lays the groundwork for this type of architecture to build software, and how React fits into it.  

## Things I Want to Know More About

- What are the differences between Object-Oriented Programming, and Compoment-Based Architecture? What are the similarities?

## Component Based Architecture  

A component, in essense, is a set of well-defined functionality. It is modular, replacable, reusable, and portable. There are many advantages to using Compoment-Based Architecture. The *reusable* and *replaceable* nature of components lead to a reduction of cost, easier system maintenance, increased reliability, and more simple deployments.  

### Characteristics of Compoments

> - **Reusability**: The compoment is typically created to be reused for different reasons, in different apps.
>
> - **Replaceable**: Components can be swapped with other compoments that are similar
>
> - **Not context specific**: This means that a compoment can work in other environments and contexts.
>
> - **Extensible**: You can extend a compoment to one that exists in order to give it a new behavior.
>
> - **Encapsulated**: The function can be called without sharing the internal workings, or any variables or states.  
>  
> - **Independent**: A component has limited dependecies on other compoments

## Props and Using React

The term ***props*** refers to a keyword within React, and is short for **properties**. It is used to describe the process of passing data between two compoments. Props are based in just one direction, from *parent* to *child*. It also means that the child component should not change the data, since React data flows unilaterally.
