# NODE.JS

## An Introduction to Node.js

1. What is node.js?

Node.js is a JavaScript engine that let's a user run JavaScript on the server-side. This means that applications can be built outside of a web environment.

2. In your own words, what is Chrome's V8 JavScript Engine?

The V8 JavaScript Engine is an open-source interpreter that is able to run in Chromium-based browsers. This allows websites to be interactive by:

- Quickly translating JS code
- Quickly executing JS code
- Employing a garbage collector to reclain memory
- Plays well with Node.js
- Supports WebAssembly

3. What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?

Saying that Node.js is a *JavaScript runtime* means that node is what is providing the environment to use JS code outside of a browser. 

4. What is npm?

**N**ode **P**ackage **M**anager is how developers manage packages that has tools and libaries, in a JavaScript Node.Js environment

5. What version of node are you runding on your machine?

> 20.8.0

6. What version of npm are you running on your machine?

> 10.2.4

7. What command would you type to install a library/package called 'jshint'?

> npm install jshint

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

1. What are 6 reasons for pair programming?

> 1. **Greater efficiency**: Pair programming may take longer, but it results in higher quality code.
> 2. **Engaged Collaboration**: Working together means that the focus and engagement is more than working alone. There's a reduction in procrastination, and greater opportunities to ask for help.
> 3. **Learning from others**: In pair programming, teammates can learn from each other, as each person has a different approach to solve a problem.
> 4. **Social skills**: Being able to communicate in a working enviornment is a strong skill that employers look for. Pair programming helps develop interpersonal skills.
> 5. **Job interview readiness**: In a lot of interview processes, pair programming with an existing employee is a way for employers to see how an applicant might fit into their existing team.
> 6. **Work environment readiness**: As a graduate of Code Fellows, we will have experience operating in a way that is the industry standard. This is one less thing an employer will have to teach us, meaning we can be more productive from the start.

2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most benefecial?

I most appreciate the *greater efficiency* of pair programming. Not only am I working on a project with someone together (meaning that our efforts are doubled), but the creativity and feature set that are delivered tend to be more than if I were doing it alone.

3. How does pair programming work?

There are two roles with pair programming: *driver* and *navigator*. The person who is the **navigator** is responsible for communicating with words to guide the driver of what to put into the computer. They are thinking about what needs to come next, or how to create the solution. The **driver** is managing the text editor, doing version control, switching files, and writing the code.
