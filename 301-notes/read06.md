# REST

## Things I Want to Know More About

## Psychological Safety

> In past careers, I've worked in environments where it was not welcomed to show vulnerability. Showing anything but perfection was seen as a failure, and it you ran into problems, it was up to you to resolve it without bringing it to the attention of supervisors or colleagues. Small issues that could have easily been resolved with an open conversation, often turned into issues that stretched on much longer than necessary. In some instances, these fears led to physical injury, equipment failures, and delays to production.

> Now that I understand the human value of centering a psychologically safe environment, I am including this a criteria when selecting a potential employer. Never again do I want to work in a career where me opening my mouth to ask a question could put my potential for advancement in jeopardy. This also goes for how I structure my teams and lead others; I will lead by example and let the action of open communication say more than empty words and catch phrases. 

## How I Explained REST to my Sibling

1. Who is Roy Fielding?

> Roy Fielding helped to write the first web servers,and helped explain why the internet works in the way it does.

2. Why don't the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

> The URL is how machines talk to each other; it creates a way for machines to tell each different machine about where things are.
> *Web Services* and *APIs* are how applications are able to send messages back and forth to each other. We have yet to do that with our techniques.

3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

> The HTTP protocol developed by Roy Fielding and friends ( sounds like a catch band name ), is called ***REST***

4. What does a **GET** do?

> When you use *GET*, the computer is asking another computer for a resource. It's receiving it in a format that can be read by a machine.

5. What does a **POST** do?

> ***POST*** creates a new resource.

6. What does **PUT** do?

> If you want to modify or update an existing resource, you'll use ***PUT***. 

7. What does **PATCH** do?

> Maybe you only need to modify and update just a part of a resource; this is when you will use ***PATCH***. Think of it like *patching* a pair of jeans.
